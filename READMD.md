# MKWii-AI

This project is designed for a school assignment. It's a Python project made to teach an AI how to play Mario Kart Wii using reinforcement learning (Rainbow DQN) and the Dolphin Emulator.

## Features

- Saves training to a file.
- Automates race restarts using save states.
- Intended for reinforcement learning and AI research.

## Requirements
All the software is what I used, I haven't tested it on other versions:
- An intermediate understanding of Python
- Python 3.12
- Dolphin Emulator 2412 (64-bit)
- A legal dump of Mario Kart Wii (PAL)
- See `requirements.txt` for dependent libraries.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Odelode/MKWii-AI
    cd MKWii-AI
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. You'll have to make your own save state in Dolphin.

4. When downloaded you will have to adjust to your own usage.

5. Run loop.py.
