# MKWii-AI

This project is designed for a school assignment. It's a Python project made to teach an AI how to play Mario Kart Wii using reinforcement learning and the Dolphin Emulator.

## Features

- Reads specific in-game memory values (e.g., lap completion) from Dolphin Emulator.
- Automates race restarts using save states.
- Intended for reinforcement learning and AI research.

## Requirements
This is what I used, I haven't tested it on other versions:
- Python 3.12
- Dolphin Emulator 2412 (64-bit)
- See `requirements.txt` for dependent libraries.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Odelode/MKWii-AI
    cd MKWii-AI
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the scripts as needed for your experiments.
